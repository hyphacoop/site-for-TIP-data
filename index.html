  <b>Quick links</b>
    📋 <a href="https://forms.gle/G6VB3uc1KUa54ht39">Registration form</a> (resubmit if your <b>cosmoshub-4</b> or <b>provider</b> key changes!)
    📅 <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/blob/master/interchain-security/SCHEDULE.md">Schedule</a>

  <b>How does TIP work?</b>
  Each period, we evaluate the following criteria:
    ✅ <b>Criteria 1:</b> Be an active mainnet validator. Submit proof via our Registration form.
    ✅ <b>Criteria 2.1:</b> Validate all available Top N consumer chains secured by the Cosmos Hub (Neutron and Stride) with > 50% uptime.
    ✅ <b>Criteria 2.2:</b> Use assigned consumer keys for all available Top N consumer chains (i.e., do not reuse your Hub key).
    ✅ <b>Criteria 3:</b> Run a testnet infrastructure setup that closely mimics mainnet.

  If you meet these three criteria (most testnet validators do), you can participate in testnet events and earn points. 
  At the end of each period, we'll translate those points into USDC and pay you for your testnet work!

      If you think we've made a mistake or need to notify us of a planned disruption in your testnet participation, email us at <b>project.cosmos@hypha.coop</b> and we may be able to make an exception.

      Exceptions are up to the discretion of the testnet coordinators. Once a period is completed and payments have been made, there will be no changes made retroactively.
